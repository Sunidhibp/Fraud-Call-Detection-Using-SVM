# Fraud-Call-Detection-Using-SVM

Phone scams are rising day by day, scammers are targeting people through phone calls for malicious purposes. People are falling for offers from scammers making them victims and disclosing their personal identifications leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. The need for effective detection methods has become more important. In this project, we propose an effective method for scam call detection with the help of machine learning algorithms and using speech-to-text libraries. By converting speech to text, our system analyzes conversations in real-time, identifying suspicious phrases and patterns which indicate scam attempts, such as requesting for sensitive information like passwords, OTP, and credit card details. If the phrases are detected as suspicious, alert prompt will be generated and sent to the user with a pop-up message, empowering them to make informed decisions about whether to trust and proceed with the call or not. If the user doesnâ€™t trust the call then certain actions will be taken such as immediately cutting the call, block the number and further report the number. Through continuous adaptation and learning, our approach aims to effectively address scam calls, enhancing user security and confidence in telephone communications.
